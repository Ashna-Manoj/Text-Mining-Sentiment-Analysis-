# Text-Mining-Sentiment-Analysis-
Involves text mining of user-review data and sentiment analysis. It is based on a collection of reviews and accompanying star ratings from Yelp. A sample of the original dataset (over 4 million review by over a million users for 144K businesses) will be used here. AIM: To examine the effectiveness of different sentiment ‘dictionaries’, and develop and evaluate classification models to help predict sentiment polarity (negative, positive). The star ratings will be used here to indicate the sentiment label. For binary classification, we will need to convert the 1-5 scale rating values to {positive(1), negative(0)} values.
